K-Means Clustering
=======

## General description
 
This project is an implementation of k-means algorithm. It starts with a random point and then iterates over the data set to find the closest point to the centroid. The centroid is then updated to be the mean of the points in the cluster. This process is repeated until the centroids converge or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
